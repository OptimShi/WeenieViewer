# WeenieViewer

* Original ACE MySQL Database source: https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE-World-16PY-Patches
* Converted ACE database into SQLite format using a purpose built tool: https://github.com/OptimShi/MySQL2SQLite
* Several systems are built using [ACE (Asheron's Call Emulator)](https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE) either as a baseline or outright lifted. I've tried to credit those sections where appropriate.
* EmoteScript is available [here](https://github.com/ACEmulator/EmoteScript)

## What is it?

WeenieViewer is a very basic tool to view different weenies (items, generators, monsters, etc) in the ACE database, an emulator for the defunct MMO Asheron's Call.

**It is currently very much incomplete.**

## How to use?

Program will attempt to open the sqlite database on load (if using the source, a copy of this database can be found in the Releases as part of the binary package). Enter a search term into the box and it will automatically search and filter as you type. Double click an result to open it and view more details.
