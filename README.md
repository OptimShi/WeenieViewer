# WeenieViewer

* ACE Database source: https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE-World-16PY-Patches
* Converted ACE database into SQLite format using https://github.com/dumblob/mysql2sqlite

## What is it?

WeenieViewer is a very basic tool to view different weenies (items, generators, monsters, etc) in the ACE database, an emulator for the defunct MMO Asheron's Call.

**It is currently very much incomplete and further progress is unlikely due to community feedback.**
